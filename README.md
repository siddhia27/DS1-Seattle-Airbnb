## Introduction
The objective of this project is to derive insights on attributes related to Seattle Airbnb Prices.
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

Early questions of interest to investigate:

How different Room Type can affect the Prices of the listings?
How Property Type can affect the prices of the listings?
How number of Bedroom can affect the prices of the listings?
Prices being affected by Seasonal Patterns.
